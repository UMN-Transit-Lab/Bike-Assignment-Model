Bicycle Routing and Assignment Model 

The code aims to
1. find shortest/optimal bike route in a network
2. assign bike trips to the network
3. geenrate travel time/distance/logsum skim tables.

Two types of routing algorithms are considered:
1. Deterministic (shortest in time or distance) routing
2. Stochastic (hyperpath-based) routing with given route choice parameters
